# NANO-Espresso-NFC
I present a preview of NANO Espresso NFC, the first coffee machine that accepts Nano. The presentation video is amateur, very amateur and I apologize for the imperfections, but none of us have experiences as a videomaker.  Next Wednesday we will be ready with the website and we will publish the source code, the hardware used and the photos necessary for anyone who wants to make the NANO Espresso NFC.  u/jayycox: thank you very much for using your trigger
